 # Question 2
 
 Imagine you're creating software for a book publisher.
 
 Your app needs to track the following information for a given book:
 
 - Book name: the name of the book being published
 - Copies sold: the number of copies sold
 - Author name: the name of the book's author
 - Selling price: the suggested price that bookstores should sell the book for
 - Year published: the year that the book was first published in

 **For each piece of information above, create a variable or constant (whatever is more appropriate).**
 
 **Then, use `print()` statements to briefly explain why you chose to use a variable or a constant for each piece of information above.**
 
 */
// Answer question 2 below
let bookName = "The Fault in Our Stars"
print("The book name should be constant because after publishing the book, the book name remains always same.")
var copiesSold = 100_000_000
print("The copies sold changes every time whenever the potential readers buy so the data type should be variable.")
let authorName = "John Green"
print("The author of the book never changes so the data type should be constant.")
var sellingPrice = 13
print("The author can change the suggested selling price whenever he/she wants so the selling price is variable.")
let yearPublished = 2013
print("When the book published, is is published. The year published never changes. Hence, the data type should be constant.")

 * Goal 2: Programming

        * I know when to use different data types (integers, floating point, Boolean, strings, et cetera) and data structures and can explain why it is important to use the correct data type or structure.

 # Question 4
 
 You are creating an app to help people be aware of how much time they spend on their phone.
 
 For a given day, this information will be tracked:
 
 * Apps: the number of different apps used today on your phone
 * Hours: the total number of hours (including part of an hour) that the screen was on
 * Most popular app: the name of the app that you used the most on a given day
 * Date: the current date (e.g.: Thursday, January 18, 2018)
 
 **Choose the appropriate data type for each piece of information**.
 
 **Then, use `print()` statements to explain why you chose a particular data type for a given piece of information.**

// Answer question 4 below
var numberOfDifferentApps = 3
print("The number of difference apps must be integer because counting should be integer such as one, two, three, four, etc.")
var totalNumberOfHours = 4.5
print("The total number of hours can be part of hours if it is minutes or seconds, so the data type should be double.")
let mostPopularApp = "Instagram"
print("The most popular app should be in strings because the name of the app would be consist of words and numbers")
let theCurrentDate = "January 26th, 2018"
print("The current date should be in strings, too, because the current date is consist of words and numbers.")
